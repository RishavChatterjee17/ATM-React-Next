This is the completed assignment for **ATM Web APP**.

---

## Project Structure

The app is separted in 2 folder:

* **atm-atm-machine-web-app** – *(frontend)*
* **atm-machine-server** – *(backend)*

The frontend use **React**, **Next (App Router)** w/ **TypeScript** and a few more things.
The backend is a simple **Node**, **Express**, **TypeScript** backend.

## Documentation Files

Check out these 2 files first for more details on how to run the project and what each fodler contains:

* **atm-machine-web-app/readme.md** – contains frontend specific doc
* **atm-machine-server/readme.md** – contains backend specific doc

## Heads up regarding browser extensions:

* I have tested it on Chrome, Edge and Mozilla.
* It works similarly on all but some UI misalignement on Mozilla happens.
* I recommend use Chrome to test the app, but should not matter really.
* Some browser extension can cause hydartion issues.
* Try disabling extensions or using incognito mode to fix issues.
* If you get connection error, make sure you are not using proxy or vpn.
* If so you might need to configure proxy and for cors add your origin URL to cors whitelist as a temporary solution
